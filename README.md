# start: Starts the server using node server.js. This is for production use.
# dev: Starts the server in development mode with nodemon, which automatically restarts the server when file changes are detected.
# lint: Runs eslint to check for code quality and style issues in .js files.
# test: Runs tests using the jest testing framework (you will need to write tests if you haven't already).
# build: Runs both the lint and test scripts before proceeding to build or deploy.
# seed: Runs a database seeding script, helpful for populating your MongoDB with initial data (assuming you have a seed.js file).
# clean: Deletes the node_modules folder and reinstalls all dependencies. Useful if you need to reset the project environment.
